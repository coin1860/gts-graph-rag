# Project Overview: Back Office Integration (BOI)

## System Role
The BOI (Back Office Integration) system serves as the primary integration layer for HSBC's global transaction systems. It facilitates the flow of data between front-end trading platforms and various back-office core banking systems.

## Global Scope
- **Geographic Coverage**: Integrated across 32 countries.
- **Service Entities**: Connects with over 60 HSBC legal entities globally.
- **Scale**: Handles high-volume transaction processing for wealth management, retail banking, and commercial banking divisions.

## Key Architect
The lead system architect for BOI is Shane. He has overseen the technical transition and integration strategy for the past three years. Note: Shane is transitioning to a dedicated engineering track starting next month.

## Architecture Pattern
The system is built on a microservices architecture to ensure high availability and regional scalability. Each service is containerized and deployed across multi-zone clusters.
