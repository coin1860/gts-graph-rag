# Handover and Knowledge Transfer: BOI Integration Layer

## Context
Current Architect: Shane (transitioning to Engineering next month).
Objective: Ensure seamless knowledge transfer for the Back Office Integration (BOI) layer due to its extreme complexity.

## Current Pain Points
- **Complexity**: 60+ microservices spanning 30+ countries.
- **Handover Difficulty**: Most knowledge is currently held by senior architects. 
- **Solution Strategy**: Implement an Agentic RAG system (GTS Graph RAG) to ingest detailed microservice documentation and interface maps to allow automated querying.

## Critical Contacts
- **Technical Lead**: Jane Doe (j.doe@hsbc.com)
- **Platform Engineering**: Mike Smith (m.smith@hsbc.com)
- **Project Manager**: Robert Brown (r.brown@hsbc.com)

## Handover Checklist
1. Review the 60+ Microservice Design Documents (Stored in SharePoint).
2. Validate current integration maps for the 30 active countries.
3. Test integration with the upcoming 'Project Genesis' core update.
4. Finalize the Knowledge Graph in Neo4j for the RAG Handover tool.
