# BOI Integration and Interface Specifications

The integration layer bridges the gap between Core HSBC systems and local regional requirements.

## Interface Categories
1. **Core Interfaces (Global)**: Standardized APIs used by major hubs (HK, UK, US). Totaling 25 main interfaces.
2. **Local Interfaces (Regional)**: Customized connectors for country-specific regulations and legacy batch systems. Totaling 35+ interfaces.

## Downstream Systems
BOI interacts with:
- **HUB-Core**: Main global ledger.
- **Regional-Batch-Processor (RBP)**: Local end-of-day settlement systems.
- **Regulatory-Reporting-Node (RRN)**: Real-time reporting to local central banks.

## Connectivity Methods
- **RESTful APIs**: Standard for modern microservice communication.
- **SFTP/MFT**: Still used for high-volume batch files with local legacy systems in certain European and Asian branches.
- **MQ (Message Queuing)**: Primary method for asynchronous event-driven integration between the BOI Orchestrator and the Transaction Ledger.
